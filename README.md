# BINARY TREES


A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children themselves are binary trees, making it a recursive data structure.

The scripts in this project contain implementations and operations related to binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and binary heaps.

## REQUIREMENTS

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
